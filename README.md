Python code written in correspondence with Coursera 3-course program, "Machine Learning Specialization", by Andrew Ng:  
  
1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification  
          -Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & scikit-learn.  
          -Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression.  
  
3. Advanced Learning Algorithms  
          -Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform mutli-class classification.  
          -Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.  
          -Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.  
  
4. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning  
          -Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.  
          -Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.  
          -Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
